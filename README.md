# PlatformJavaClient (DEPRECATED)
*PlatformJavaClient* makes it easy to start using [DocuWare Platform API](http://help.docuware.com/sdk/platform). 

As of today 12.08.16 the JavaClient applies to DocuWare Version 6.10 and is in Beta Phase, therefore bugs may occur and there is no documentation. The Java Client is supposed to reflect the same Client implementation as the .Net Client as far as possible, thus most of the samples in the .Net Client's documentation also apply to the Java Client. 

Please help improving the Client with your feedback, additionally, everyone is very welcome to provide missing code examples.

### Source code
Clone the sources: `git clone https://github.com/DocuWare/PlatformJavaClient.git`

### Building
You need at least a *Java 8* installation of any edition.
To get started:
* Clone the source code (see above).
* Or: Start a new Project in your IDE and just copy all files of the PlatformClientProject into it. Overwrite your files if necessary. The project will be named JavaPlatformClient afterwards.

### Supported DocuWare versions
This implementation uses the *DocuWare Platform .NET API* of ***DocuWare 6.10***.  
Most of the examples will also run with *DocuWare 6.5* or higher.

### Known Issues: 
* Error messages may be too short or wrong

### Major missing Features
* Some classes/methods from the .NetClient are still missing
